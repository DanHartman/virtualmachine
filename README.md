## Common Virtualbox Development
Repo for reducing the number of times I make a new
Vagrantfile.  The thought is to include this inside other repos.


requirements:
*  vagrant
*  ansible

installation:
*  clone this repo inside your top level project

*  will automatically mount your `/src` folder to internal `/mnt` so make sure you have a `/src` folder
